        <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF TEAK</h2>
        <p>
            All our furniture is manufactured at our factories in Burma. We export worldwide whilst still maintaining a strong foothold in South East Asia. Tectonis Grandis, the locals also call it SAC, is one the worlds premier hardwood timbers. It is famous for its mellow colour, fine grain and durability. It occurs naturally only in Thailand, India, Burma and Lao. It&#39;	s also well established in tropical Africa. It&#39;	s also been introduced into a number of other countries at trial levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            The durability and workability of teak was recognized many centuries ago, leading to it&#39;	s widespread distribution and cultivation throughout the tropics. Today teak ranks as the premier hardwood for use in extreme conditions and in the production of fine furniture and intricate carvings, there is nothing better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most furniture can be crafted from reclaimed teak. Unfortunately there are many unscrupulous operators who rather than take the time and effort to source widely available reclaimed teak plunder already dangerously low reserves of new teak for quick profits. Their conscience allows them to use new growth teak which is machine lathed and then screwed and glued. It takes a craftsman to use reclaimed teak and they are a scarce resource. We operate an apprentice scheme and sponsor our new apprentices and encourage them to learn traditional skills in order to secure their future and ours.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Thailand, harvesting of teak has been prohibited since 1989; supply from Lao has also been drastically constrained. This is quite worrying when you consider the massive market for teak products throughout Thailand and the rest of Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Investment is needed in developing sustainable teak plantations for the future demands of this valuable hardwood. Many parts of Asia are scarred by deforestation, leading to widespread soil erosion, flooding and the elimination of many hill tribes.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you purchase teak furniture please ask the salesperson about the origin of the raw materials used in constructing the piece of furniture. We all need to act responsibly in protecting a valuable and valued resource for future generations.
