# Factories

<div class="container col-lg-6" style="margin-left:0px; margin-bottom:20px; ">
Our furniture is manufactured in five facilities scattered around the Myawaddy region. Each factory sustains a small village where the majority of the villagers are employed. We provide above average salaries along with healthcare and education for the children.<br>

<div class="container col-lg-6" style="margin-left:0px; margin-bottom:20px; ">
Our apprentice scheme is staffed by semi-retired craftsmen/artisans. Each apprentice is fully trained over a five year period with a full-time job at the end of it.<br>

<div class="container col-lg-6" style="margin-left:0px; margin-bottom:20px; ">
We are also responsible for the welfare of retired staff and their families as part of our approach to looking after and supporting our people.<br>
