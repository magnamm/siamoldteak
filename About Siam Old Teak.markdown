# ABOUT SIAM OLD TEAK

We formed our company to be different. The market in Thailand had many retailers selling very similar furniture, much of it sourced in Chiang Mai or imported from Malaysia and Indonesia. There was no one offering a truly bespoke personal service. 

Rubber Wood furniture was being dumped into the Thai market and we could see a real opportunity for high quality furniture. 

Our objective is to create a bespoke service of design and furniture that has style and longevity. Our designs draw inspiration from classical architecture and styles. Each commission begins with the very intimate process of working with the client to ensure the designs reflect their needs and taste. Every piece of furniture is made to the most exacting standards using the finest materials and traditional cabinet-making techniques, and each element of the interiors is addressed with the same care and attention to detail. 

Despite the demands of an exacting clientele our team maintains a refreshing, down to earth and positive approach to all challenges, with the result that much of our business is by referral or new projects for happy clients and their families. 

Siam Old Teak has built an impressive portfolio with furniture and interiors commissions worldwide.
