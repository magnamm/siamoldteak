# MATERIALS
Materials are the backbone of our designs. Only the best is used: Burmese reclaimed teak; Italian leather of the highest quality; as well as a plethora of other materials, both modern and classical, used in interesting and ingenious ways.

## Italian aniline leather
Leather is imported directly from Italy and is a natural grain Grade &#39;A&#39; leather. The cushion pads are flame retardant and comply with the relevant EU standards. We use a rigid hardwood frame which was originally designed for the UK market, which we still supply. We also export to USA, Canada, Japan and Korea. We can make the sofa or side chair to your specifications, with minimal additional cost.

## Whats available out there ?
The majority of leather available in South East Asia has it&#39;s origins in China, the leather is often described as &#39;easy clean&#39; The leather is artificially embellished top grain veneer. Many sofas also contain imitation leather especially on sofa backs and below the cushion/seat line. The product we offer is not competing with the lower priced imitations, our furniture is suitable for heavy use and will last for many years, we also have our sofas and chairs in daily use in hotels, restaurants and bars. We meet many customers who admit to &#39;banning&#39; their more robust friends from using relatively new sofa&#39;s and chairs. Furniture should be used and admired, choosing a lower priced option will often leave you feeling cheated in both these aspects.
&quot; if we wouldn&#39;t have it in our home rest assured we wouldn&#39;t send it to yours &quot;
