We spend much of our time in Europe discussing our clients furnishings and can provide a solution to most clients budgets.

## Quality
Siam Old Teak build furniture to last, and is always of excellent quality. Our furniture comes fully assembled after 8-12 weeks of careful construction and attention is made to the finest details. We use traditional construction methods, mortise and tenon joints, pin and dowel techniques, and dovetail joints for extra strength. Our furniture is 100% solid reclaimed teak. We never use MDF/Particle Boards/Veneers, Rubber Wood/Para Wood or bamboo, these materials soon lose their showroom lustre and don&#39;t stand the test of time.
