# CORPORATE COMMISSIONS
## Restaurants
We understand that restaurants must be striking and breathtakingly elegant, while at the same time a comfortable environment encouraging conviviality and good cheer. Each restaurant has its own personality which must be both timeless and in keeping with the current zeitgeist.


## Hotels
Whether its a boutique hotel or national chain we will work with you to create a unique experience for your guests. 
We can deliver an entire hotel scheme including interior design concepts and brand identities, as well as specific stand alone areas and facilities such as restaurant, bar, bedroom, lobby and meeting room design. 
A work in progress: the design and refurbishment of a luxury five-star hotel. The rooms are designed to reflect the hotel&#39;s history and classical style, drawing inspiration from the beautiful art-deco bronzes on display throughout the interiors. (pictures to follow)


## Bars and Public Houses
We have created many successful drinking establishments - including several major award winners, for both entrepreneurial independents and national operators. 
Clients operating traditional pubs, contemporary bars, cocktail bars, sophisticated hotel hospitality, have benefited from our experience.


## Boardrooms
The boardroom is often the showroom of a large corporation: cutting edge, striking and technologically smart design is crucial to create the right impressions.


## Offices
Our belief is that the aesthetics of a work environment closely affects productivity and creativity: and we keep that firmly in mind when drawing up and designing offices.
Siam Old Teak&#39;s design process for corporate commissions fuses classical and contemporary inspiration with the demands of the working environment and the accommodation of everything technology.
