# PRIVATE COMMISSIONS
Our private commissions process combines a sharp design intellect married with an appreciation of the space our furniture needs to inhabit and the understanding of each client&#39;s needs and wishes. It is this combination that has made Siam Old Teak so successful in creating beautiful pieces in complete harmony with their environments.
